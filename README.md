# Fastest Route Finder

> **Notice**: This project is a subset of a larger application. For the full implementation and additional features, please refer to [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/Eroaleee/Bringo_Demo).

## Overview

This repository contains a Fastest Route Finder application that determines the quickest path between multiple locations using the Google Maps API. The application utilizes various algorithmic techniques, including Dynamic Programming (DP), pruning, linear interpolation, and backtracking, to efficiently find the optimal route.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration**: Utilizes the Google Maps API for accurate and up-to-date route information.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Implements DP to optimize route calculations and reduce computation time.
- **Pruning**: Employs pruning techniques to eliminate non-promising paths and enhance performance.
- **Linear Interpolation**: Uses linear interpolation for smoother and more precise route estimations.
- **Backtracking**: Implements backtracking to explore all possible routes and ensure the optimal path is found.
